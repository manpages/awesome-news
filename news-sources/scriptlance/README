So that's Scriptlance project notification callback thingie.
With some really cosmetic tweaks can be transformed into generic mutt mail notifier.

To get it running just update your .procmailrc according to the ./procmailrc. Make sure
that it points to the correct place of the shell script and that the php script is found
correctly by the shell script.

By default, it sends notifications to an_google_chrome (started as server.sh google_chrome),
an_generic_receiver and an_libnotify.
